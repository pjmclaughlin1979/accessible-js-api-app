# Accessible JS API app

The goal of this app is to create a very accessible app with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript that leverages both the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) and the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) specs to meet 508 compliance.

This app has several interesting features including:

* Skip links for the search and list
* ARIA live regions for speaking dynamic text to users
* Semantic document structure
